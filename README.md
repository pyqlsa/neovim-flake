# neovim-flake
My personal neovim configuration, (very) largely inspired by:
- https://github.com/nickryand
- https://github.com/wiltaylor/neovim-flake
- https://github.com/jordanisaacs/neovim-flake
- https://github.com/gvolpe/neovim-flake

I'm very grateful to all of the above for sharing their work, this flake wouldn't exist without them.
