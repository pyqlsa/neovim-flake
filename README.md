# neovim-flake
A nix flake for neovim with with my personal configuration.

It is bound to change, so a fork is recommended over pointing to directly.

## Take it for a spin
Clone the repo and run the following from the root of the project:
```bash
nix run .#
```
or
```bash
nix run github:pyqlsa/neovim-flake
```

## Update plugins
```bash
nix flake update
```
